# ts-artifacts-mmo-sandbox

A TypeScript sandbox for [Artifacts MMO](https://artifactsmmo.com).

I'm using this space to learn about the game and develop some basic tooling.

TODOs:

- `[ ]` Gather copper ores and turn it into copper
- `[ ]` Use copper ores to make equipment
- `[ ]` Do some fishing
- `[ ]` Cook fish to create consumables
- `[ ]` Level Weaponcrafting to 5
- `[ ]` Create more powerful weapons

Incomplete list of concepts to explore:

- `[ ]` Tasks
- `[ ]` Recycling
- `[ ]` Grand Exchange
